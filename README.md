# Distinctiveness and Complexity:

This is an online community library where people can share and download books. Guest users who are not logged in can search for the books that they want and download them. Users who are signed in can donate books for other people as well as edit and delete the books they have donated.

This final project is distinct from all of the previous projects because none of the previous projects let the users upload and download files. It has an additional feature that make it more complex than other projects is that when a book is updated, it will appear at the top of the list when displayed on a page. It is not a social network because it doesn't let any user like or comment on other users's uploads. It is also not an e-commerce app because it don't let the users sell or buy things. This app is simply a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app to store and manage files.
